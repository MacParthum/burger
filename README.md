# Burger logger

A cool little burger logger app that uses mysql, node, Express, express-handlebars and an orm file to let the user add new burgers and delete old burgers.  Pretty fun to play around with. Teaches the basics of MVC which stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application into three components - Model, View, and Controller. Model: Model represents the shape of the data.  Model objects store data retrieved from the database.  This is our first class assignment using Handlebars which compile templates into JavaScript functions. This makes the template execution faster than most other template engines.
